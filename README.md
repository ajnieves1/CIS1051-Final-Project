# CIS1051-Final-Project
C# In Unity

Prototype 
Andrew Nieves

I had difficulties with scaling my current movement and animation script. Whenever I add something new, such as camera relative movement, the animations become out of sync. I've ultimately decided to ignore the bugs that I encountered and focus on new features as I wanted to prototype as many things as possible, and outside of this class I will work on the debugging portion. 
I learned the math behind coding jumping physics in games, in addition to learning more about C# such as public and private classes and why its so important when developing in Unity. I learned how to create a movement and camera controller from scratch, in addition to learning animation and calling animations when inputs are triggered (such as running or jumping). I also created a grass culling script similar to how you can cut grass in the Zelda series; however, I didn't get a chance to implement it and demonstrate as that also caused problems with my character script. The grass tool is by far the most advanced. I followed a tutorial on it as grass physics interest me. Admittedly, that is the hardest syntax I've ever read (in terms of the math behind the physics), but I'm eager to learn more. I hope to create a library of scripts that I can reuse for any future endeavors in Unity. My learning goal right now is scaleability. 
Ultimately, this was a fun and satisfying experience and I genuinely want to learn more and eventually create a somewhat full game by the time of my graduation.
